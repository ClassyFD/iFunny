          `I am 16 years old, and have struggled with severe depression for as long as I can remember. On September 27th of last year, I attempted suicide and was pronounced dead for over 10 minutes. After waking up from a week long coma, I was shuttled to mental rehab where I spent the next six months. I was released on superbowl day. When I got home, I got my phone and decided to download a new app or two, as I didn't have any games or anything of the sort on it. Your App, iFunny, was the first one on the list of recommended that day. So I downloaded it. And from there on out, every time I feel a little depression coming on, or even if I'm just bored, your app has always been able to put a smile on my face. So thank you, iFunny team, for making the coolest young adult app on the market :)`,
          `I was hanging off the edge of a cliff after an avalanche and as I was trying to find a decent grip, my phone notified me that there were new features. I used my right hand to start looking though them and because of this I couldn't hold on with just my left hand. I fell 30 feet to the ground and I couldn't even get through all the features. Luckily I only broke every bone in my body except my right hand (which I'm using to write this review with). Good app but beware. I'd say the safest place to use this is on the toilet but that's just me.`,
          `Tell my family that I died while laughing.`,
          `Probably the only app I can say that I have used for 6 straight hours.`,

          `First app I download when I get a new iPhone or iPod.`,

          `I go on my phone about 17 hours in a day and about 16 1/2 of those hours are spent on iFunny.`,
          `Why does this app not have any awards yet. Like, iFunny is more famous than Batman. Seriously this app is like Leonardo Dicaprio. So much talent packed into one single thing! Yet no awards.`
